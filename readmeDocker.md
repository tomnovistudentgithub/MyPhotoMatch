# Step 1: Build the Docker image
# Replace <image-name> with the name you want for your Docker image
docker build -t <image-name> .

# Step 2: Tag the Docker image
# Replace <docker-repo> with the name of your Docker repository
# Replace <tag> with the tag you want for your Docker image
docker tag <image-name> <docker-repo>:<tag>

# Step 3: Push the Docker image to the Docker repository
docker push <docker-repo>:<tag>

The docker buildx build command requires exactly one argument, which is the path to the build context. The build context is often the current directory, which is represented by a . (dot).  If you're running the command in the directory that contains your Dockerfile, you can use the following command:
docker buildx build .

This command tells Docker to use the current directory (.) as the build context. The Dockerfile in the current directory will be used to build the Docker image.
